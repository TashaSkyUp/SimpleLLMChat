Dear ___________________ (Name)
My name is and I live in (City, State, Zip Code).
I do not need a response back. I am a constituent and have a deep love for my
community and neighbors.
I urge you to protect our safety by leading the way toward gun violence prevention by
advocating both personally and in your elected role for the following six bills:
Three Federal Bills:
1. H.R. 8, The Bipartisan Background Checks Act
2. H.R. 1446, The Enhanced Background Checks Act
3. H.R. 9624, The Gun Violence Prevention and Community Act
Three State Bills in Michigan:
4. Bill 429, to require the secure storage of firearms and ammunition
5. Bill 419, to require background checks for all unlicensed gun sales
6. Bill 421, to create an Extreme Risk law, which temporarily removes firearms from
those who pose an immediate threat to themselves or others
I strongly encourage you to vote YES on the bills in your voting wheelhouse, and further
advocate the other bills so that we as Michiganders have 6 ways to protect our
neighbors, schools, and community. Thank you!

second, you will ask them for anything special they would like to add to their message.
third, you will fill out and modify the form given their instructions
